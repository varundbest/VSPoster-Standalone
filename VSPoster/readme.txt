 Upload script to your host. Strongly recommended to protect folder with password to prevent unwanted activity from web (if you wont protect it with password your login details will be visible from web).

1. Configure your accounts on configure accounts screen.
2. Configure your desired settings on settings scree like referrer and timeouts.

Timeouts is used to give up after defined time (example: if MySpace loading takes more than 30 seconds skip it and continue with next site). 

Timeouts summary should not be more than 299 seconds (dont change them before you get any timeout errors).

Don't spam your accounts to death or they will be banned.

For using it locally you need to install xampp , wamp or something like those two.

There is no point to write description longer than 500 characters they will be shortened. My suggestion is to write at least 100 characters!

To disable some sites just leave username as blank and it will be skipped.

Indexer is ment for domain only no point to submit your posts or pages to there they will be stripped down so only domain is left.

Enjoy.

PS: If you having problems with saving your login details do following

open up your VSPoster folder and then folder named "db" set chmod 777 for following files(folders)

file1: config.xml
file2: settings.xml
folder: tmp


And should be fine.
