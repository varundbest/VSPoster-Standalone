You can try it live at - http://http://www.premnathdevelopers.com/VSPoster/

This is an Old Social Bookmarking Tool I created back in 2010.
A lot has changed since then. Do Not expect it to work for most sites, some of the supported sites have been shut down.
Some sites may require minor tinkering to work again.
The purpose of this is to provide a basic template for people to work on, its better than writing your code from the scratch.
Feel free to submit any changes to the code.
